- Created a repository for writing notes.
- Data Engineering: What is it?
  - Social Networks
  - Data Analytics 
    - Sampling 
    - Machine learning
  - Storage
    - NoSQL
    - Document databases
    - Graph databases
    - Key-value stores
    - Colomner stores (not key-values; different)
  - Big data
  - Data collection and cleaning
    - How to access it?
    - Has to clean before it can be stored
    - Example
      - Twitter --> clients

  - Infoviz
    - Huge data sets, how do you view them to the user?
    - D3 (JS framework)
    - Tablo
    - R
  - Data engineering
    - Data life cycle
    - Question -> curation triage --> prioritization [DATA SCIENTIST]. Collection generation [SOFTWARE ENGINEERS] --> clean up     [SOFTWARE ENGINEERS] --> storage [SOFTWARE ENGINEERS] <-- --> processing/analysis [DATA SCIENTISTS] --> query + visualize + act [DATA SCIENTISTS]
- Big Data
  - Request response cycle 
  - Type http:// --> access HTML file. HTTP request. Network protocol. --> Get --> POST --> PUT --> DEL
